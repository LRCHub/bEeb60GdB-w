From your mixed up masquerade
I must recognize some familiar face in your eyes
Well it ain't over you're dead and gone
I really hope you don't wait that long
Well it ain't over till you're just a memory
Well I'm trying to remember how my lover set me free
Could I have misread
Just a dream inside my head
Well it's so hard to believe
How you're just my beautiful mystery
Well it ain't over 'till you're dead and gone
It's ok if you wanna wait that long
Well it ain't over 'till you're just a memory
Well I'm trying to remember how my lover set me free
Well it's not the way I feel when your by my side
It's not the look I see in other people's eyes

You've got a part of me that I recognize
Yeah yeah
There's no disguise
Well I'm lookin at your eyes
I'm not gonna try to change your -- change your mind
You've got all you need
But if you ever really need don't feel afraid to call
On me
Well it ain't over you're dead and gone
I really hope you don't wait that long
Well it ain't over till you're just a memory
Well I'm trying to remember how my lover set me free
Well it's not the way I feel when your by my side
It's not the look I see in other people's eyes
Must be something real that I just can't hide
You've got some part of me that I recognize
Yeah yeah
There's no disguise
Well I'm lookin at your eyes
Hmmmm hmmmm
