You call it magic, but it seems to me
It's all in my mind
It's all in my mind
You call it special, but I'm thinking maybe
Those were the only words that you could find
You needed perfect, but I'll always be
A master of imperfection, I'll be
You wanted flawless now, but don't you see
You've been looking in the wrong direction

Will I recognize faith
If seen in your eyes
Or run from the truth
And believe my own lies
Will I know when to trust you
To catch me if I fall
Will I recognize love at all

You called it summer, but it feels so cold
As early winter rain I was told
You called it easy, but my hearts growing old
From the habits of avoiding the pain

Will I recognize faith
If seen in your eyes
Or run from the truth
And believe my own lies
Will I know when to trust you
To catch me if I fall
Will I recognize love at all

I'm scared
I'm frightened 'cause I need to understand
But now I don't know who I am
Anymore

Will I recognize faith
If seen in your eyes
Or run from the truth
And believe my own lies
Will I know when to trust you
To catch me if I fall
Will I recognize love at all
